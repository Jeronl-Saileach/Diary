## **Risk Management**

#### **1.Hardware unavailability**

​	**(1) Affect**: Project 

​	**(2) Description**:  Hardware that is essential for the project will not be
​		delivered on schedule.

​	**(3) Avoidance strategies**: Timely installation of hardware related security patches and updates to protect against known 		security vulnerabilities and threats.

​	**(4) Minimization strategies**:Upload the code to GitHub for backup,Enable automatic backup.

​	**(5)Contingency plans**:Rewrite the missing code.

#### **2.Teammate sick** 

​	**(1)Affect**: Project 

​	**(2)Description**: The teammate is  sick so that this teammate cannot go on with work.

​	**(3)Avoidance strategies**: Practice good personal hygiene and rise a healthy lifestyle.

​	**(4)Minimization strategies**: Upload the code to GitHub for trake the progress.

​	**(5)Contingency plans**: Communicate with sick team members to understand their specific illness and expected recovery 		time,Adjust team members' tasks according to their condition and project schedule. For urgent and important tasks, 		consider letting other team members take over or assist them.

#### **3.Size underestimate**

​	**(1)Affect**:Project and product

​	**(2)Decription**: The size of the system has been underestimated.

​	**(3)Avoidance strategies**: Reasonably plan the needs of the project, determine the project function as soon as possible in 		order to make a reasonable judgment of the engineering quantity.

​	**(4)Minimization strategies**:Make a clear assessment ofown ability before the project, and  fully communicate with team 		members about my own ability to allocate work reasonably.

​	**(5)Contingency plans**: Change project requirements and functions in a timely manner to reduce project size to ensure 		timely delivery

#### **4.Difficulty underestimate**

​	**(1)Affect**: Project and product 

​	**(2)Description**: Some function is too hard to achieve 

​	**(3)Avoidance strategies**: Evaluate and communicate your abilities to ensure that the difficulty of performing the function is 		moderate.

​	**(4)Contingency plans**: Report the bottleneck with the team members in time, or discuss the problem with the relevant 		teacher. If the problem still cannot be solved, you can abandon or change this function after discussing with the team 		members.

#### **5.Handover question**

​	**(1)Affect**: Project and product

​	**(2)Description**: Different environment configurations and different code styles cause the code to become less readable and 		can not run properly on the hardware of the recipient.

​	**(3)Avoidance strategies**: Ensure that the development environment is consistent and proper comments to help the 		transition understand.

​	**(4)Contingency plans**: Hold team meetings to help team members transition smoothly and configure the environment 		correctly.
